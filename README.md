## What the...?

This is a Chef server written in Java; it is sufficient to pass 95% of
chef-pedant without validation or authentication. 

## Why the...?

For funsies (see also masochism) also because I wanted to learn more
about how our servers do their work while I've been working on
chef-metal. 

## Why would I...?

You probably wouldn't - not yet anyway; it's purely in-memory but it's
pretty fast with zero profiling work done. This may never see more work,
who knows. It has metrics and can be run with a single JAR file so all
you need is the JVM. 

## In the future...

Working on some persistence engine support, implementing Solr for
searching and other bits. If people are interested, this may get more
attention.
